# What do we want to save from the current okfn.org (soon to be old okfn.org)?

The Open Knowledge Foundation staff was asked about what on the current okfn.org site must be moved and maintained on the new site.

## Other conent

The following list contains content available in the navigation bar that wasn't mentioned by and Open Knowledge Foundation member. That does not mean that it isn't important, just not important to those who answered. The Web Redesign team must therefore think about the items and make judgements whether to include or exclude it on the new page.

* Working groups, local groups and task force, although that can be inferred from the *Get involved*
* Events (these are probably pretty important, at least around the time they happen)
* Press releases and Press pages

The Web Redesign team should also consider links to subdomains such as for example [around the network](http://planet.okfn.org) or all of the projects. These are not content on the current site but they might need to be present on the new page. It doesn't have to be in the main navigational bar though, but they can be included as part of other pages.
