# Navigation for the site

## Problem

Decide on how navigation will work on the site (navigation bars, footers etc.) and get approval from heads of units.

## Decision

The proposed navigation we will work from now is documented in a [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/15svwaQhOMaYNgf-pz3Z92nGGHAnet8lm8KRtRC23xno/edit).

This is considered ready for review by leadership and head of units and the team will work based on this navigation until improvements are suggested.
